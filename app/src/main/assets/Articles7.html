    <dd>
        Normally, array is a collection of similar type of elements that have contiguous memory location.

        Java array is an object the contains elements of similar data type.
        It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store
        only fixed set of elements in a java array.

        Array in java is index based, first element of the array is stored at 0 index.

    <dt class="text-danger">Advantage of Java Array</dt>
    <dd>
        1.Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data easily.
        2.Random access: We can get any data located at any index position.

    <dt class="text-danger">Disadvantage of Java Array</dt>
    <dd>
        Size Limit: We can store only fixed size of elements in the array.
        It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in java.
